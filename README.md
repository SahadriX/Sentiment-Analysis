## 😊 Sentiment-Analysis

A project that classifies text data (such as tweets or reviews) into **positive** or **negative** sentiment using machine learning techniques.

---

### 🧠 Project Objective
To analyze and classify customer opinions or social media content by:
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw text data 🧹  
- Extracting meaningful features with TF-IDF vectorization 🔤  
- Training classification models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes 🤖

---

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 🧠 scikit-learn  
- 📝 Text preprocessing libraries  
- 📊 Pandas & NumPy  
- 📈 TF-IDF vectorizer for feature extraction

---

### 🧩 Key Features
- 🔍 Text cleaning and preprocessing  
- 🔤 TF-IDF vectorization to convert text to numeric features  
- 🤖 Model training with Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes  
- 📊 Sentiment classification into positive or negative categories

---

### 🧮 How the Model Works
1. **Preprocess text**: cleaning, removing noise, tokenization  
2. **Feature extraction**: apply TF-IDF vectorizer  
3. **Train ML models**: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes  
4. **Evaluate models**: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
5. **Classify new text** based on learned patterns
